# Unit 6 - Pythonic Monopoly

------------------

## **Objective:**

Create a dashboard that provides charts, maps, and interactive vizualizations that help customers explore data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in Toronto.

## **How to use Dashboard**

After running the code, an interactive dashboard titled "Toronto Real Estate Analysis (2001 to 2016)" will appear at the bottom of the Jupyter Notebook.

### **Welcome Screen:**
The user is greeted by a welcome screen on the dashboard that gives a brief explanation of what the dashboard does.  Beneath the explanation is an interactive map of Toronto that displays the average house value in a colour-coded manner.

### **Yearly Market Analysis:**
The Yearly Market Analysis tab contains charts that display the number of units per dwelling type in Toronto aross four years: 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016.  The charts make it easy to see the distribution and growth of the various dwelling types.

### **Shelter Costs Vs. House Value:**
This tab has three line charts.  The first one displays the average monthly shelter costs for owned dwellings from years 2001 to 2016.

The second chart displays the average monthly shelter costs for rented dwellings from years 2001 to 2016.

The third chart displays the average house values in Toronto from 2001 to 2016.

All three line charts provide a clear visual of the cost/value movements over the years.

### **Neighbourhood Analysis:**

This tab contains four bar charts that display the average house values across the various neighbourhoods in Toronto for the years 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016.  It makes it visually apparent which neighbourhoods currently have the most valuable properties, which neighbourhoods are holding their property values the best, and which neighbourhoods are experiencing the greatest appreciation in property value.

### **Top Expensive Neighbourhood:**
The final tab displays two charts.  The first one is a bar chart that displays the top 10 most expensive neighbourhoods in Toronto and their average house values.

The second one is a sunburst chart that displays the shelter costs for owned properties across the top 10 most expensive neighbourhoods for the years 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016.
